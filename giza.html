			<h1>Great Pyramid of Giza</h1>
			<p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of three pyramids in the Giza Pyramid Complex. Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu, some Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was thus built as a tomb, taking 10 to 20 years to build. The Great Pyramid has three known chambers in it, however the lowest chamber is unfinished. </p>
			<p>The Great Pyramid is made of 2.3 million blocks, carried across the river from nearby quarries.</p>
			<p>It is not yet known how the pyramids were built, but they appear to have been built by skilled Egyptian workers</p>
